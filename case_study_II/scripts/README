Note that the protocol used here had the wrong order: the equilibration was carried out before the prepareFEP, which maps how the atoms should be perturbed between ligand1 and ligand2. This means that in a few cases the protein leg and the water leg of the ddG used a slightly different perturbation map. We repaired that in this case by modifying the prepareFEP.py script here in this directory. Specifically, we load the perturbation maps from the other leg to ensure that the perturbation are exactly the same. However, for the future we recommend running the prepareFEP and then the equilibrate script. This order (based on two cases checked) ensures that the perturbations are exactly the same across the two legs. For this reason the official instructions (which are equivalent) on the main page use the updated order.
